# TalkingClock
Based on the Tetris Clock but with mp3 player

Updated version 1.1:
Access point **bug** fixed: Name of access point now correct: Geniusweb
wifi settings **bug** fixed: name and password can now be up to 35 characters
Wifi **bug** fixed: with wpa protocol, system won't boot to wifi without disconnecting. Was related to the order in which things are initialized.


If your display is not working, maybe you have installed the wrong version of the I2s Display driver.
You can test it by using the webprogrammer ( with Chrome or edge only) if the display is working when you are using this pre compiled version it means you have a library version incompatibility
